	  <h1>Damian Satterthwaite-Phillips, PhD</h1>
	  <h2>Company Founder and Principal Consultant</h2>
	</hgroup>
	<p>
	  Damian received his doctorate in anthropology at Stanford University in 2011, where his
	  research focused on developing statistical methods for inferring the historical 
	  relationships between languages.  In the course of this research, he spent several 
	  years in China gathering data on several endangered languages.
	</p>
       	<p>
	  After completing his doctorate, Damian went on to do postdoctoral research at the 
	  Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS)--a division of the Prairie Research Institute 
	  at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  During his time at INHS, he served
	  primarily as a statistician and mathematical modeler.  While furthering his statistical
	  education, he applied these methods to research in wildlife management.  He was 
	  involved in multiple research projects, including:<br/>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651313003400">
		Research on toxins in Illinois watersheds</a></li>
	    <li>
	      Developing methods for inferring predator diets from their fatty acid content
	      (in press with the  <em>Journal of Animal Science and Technology</em>; link 
	      forthcoming). 
	      <a href="http://wwx.inhs.illinois.edu/files/4313/3943/5464/Winter2012.pdf">
		Brief Report (p. 4-5)
	      </a>
	    </li>
	    <li>Research on the effects of culling diseased deer on population dynamics.  Interim
	      report 
	      <a href="http://wwx.inhs.illinois.edu/files/4113/7357/5137/Summer2012.pdf">
		here (p. 4-5)</a>. Fuller academic report currently in preparation.
	    <li>Research on the role of heavy metals in white-tailed deer susceptibility to 
	      chronic wasting disease (journal article currently in peer review).</li>
	  </ul>  
	</p>
	<p>
	  After completion of his postdoctorate, Damian went on to be the lead scientist for a
	  subsistence mapping project at the <a href="nwabor.org">Northwest Arctic Borough</a>
	  in Alaska.  The Borough is a native home-rule government, and the mapping project 
	  documents current land use by the local IÃ±upiaq ("Eskimo") population, documenting 
	  where hunting, trapping, fishing, and plant gathering occur. The mapping project is 
	  intended to serve as a tool to help development occur in a way that minimally impacts
	  subsistence resources.  Phillips Research & Analytics continues to collaborate with 
	  the Borough on this project.  Working drafts of the project methods can be found 
	  <a href="http://nwabor.org/pdfs/MappingLandUseforSubsitenceResourcesinArcticAlaska.pdf">
	    here</a> (academic paper), and 
	  <a href="http://nwabor.org/pdfs/Methods_29Apr2014.pdf">here</a> (in-house methods 
	  document).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Damian has also performed statistical analyses for social scientists.  He 
	  collaborated with anthropologist conducting research on the role of women's labor and
	  marriage mobility in China. See article 
	  <a href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8768246&fulltextType=RA&fileId=S0021911812001271">
	    here</a>.  He is currently working with one of the coauthors on a similar publication
	  to be submitted for publication soon.
