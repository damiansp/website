	<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Owner and Principal.  Phillips Research and Analytics. Boulder, CO. 2014 - Present.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Anthropologist, Data Analyst, and Webmaster. Northwest Arctic Borough; Planning 
	    Dept. Kotzebue, Alaska. 2013 - 2014.<br />
	    The Northwest Arctic Borough is comprised of several native Iñupiat communities. I
	    was hired on as the anthropologist involved in a mapping project. Via interviews 
	    with elders and experienced hunters and gatherers, we developed a database of
	    geographical regions that are important for subsistence and food security in this
	    region. The Borough (a native government body) intends to use these data to help 
	    direct future planning in the region in such a way that food security may be 
	    maintained. I was responsible for developing and administering the social science 
	    methods, and analyzing the data.  A public release of these data is anticipated in
	    late 2014. Working drafts of the project methods can be found
            <a href="http://nwabor.org/pdfs/subsistence_mapping_project_methods_Appendix_E.pdf">
              here</a> or
