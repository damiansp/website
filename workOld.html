	  <h2>River Otters in Illinois</h2>
	  <h3>Tracking Toxins in the Watershed</h3>

	  <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147651313003400">Link to
	    publication.</a><br />
	  Working with a team of scientists at the 
	  <a href="http://wwx.inhs.illinois.edu/">Illinois Natural History Survey</a>, (part of 
	  the Prairie Research Institute at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), 
	  PRA principal, Damian Satterthwaite-Phillips provided statistical support, and aided in
	  research on levels of various toxic chemicals in Illinois' watersheds. Some of these 
	  chemicals come from pesticides (some of which have been illegal for several decades) 
	  and some of their byproducts, while others are common in electronics and transformers.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Because these chemicals accumulate up the food chain, predators such as otters tend to
	  accumulate higher amounts of these toxins than other organisms, and are hence known as
	  "sentinel species" because they register dangerous levels of toxins sooner than other
	  species.  
	</p>
	<p>
	  We compared toxin levels in otter livers today to those reported 25-30 years ago.  
	  Surprisingly, we found levels of dieldrin, a toxic byproduct of some 
	  pesticides, are higher now than they were 30 years ago, even though those products have
	  been banned for about 25 years.  In fact, the levels of dieldrin found in Illinois are
	  higher than those ever reported anywhere else in the US.

	    We did not have the raw data from the earlier research, only means and standard 
	    deviations.  Using kernel density estimates of the distributions of the toxins in the 
	    population today, we assumed that the shape of the distribution was similar 25-30 years
	    ago.  We therefore simulated the earlier distribution as identical in shape to the 
	    modern distribution, but with a shifted mean to match the known data.  By doing 
	    repeated random samplings from the simulated distrubution, we confirmed that the 
	    simulated data matched the published data's standard deviations, suggesting the 
	    simulated distribution was a good match.  By doing thousands of bootstrapped samplings
	    from the simulated distribution that mimicked the sample size in the earlier study, we
	    were able to produce a 95% confidence interval of the mean levels of toxins in the
	    earlier study, and determine if they differed significantly from the mean levels seen 
	    today.

	<h3 class="clear">Inferring Diet from fat composition</h3>
	<p>
	  <a href="http://www.janimscitechnol.com/content/56/1/16/abstract">
	    Link to publication</a>.<br />
	  River otters have recently been reintroduced to much of Illinois and the Midwest after
	  being wiped out from these areas during the 1800s.  However, because they have been 
	  absent from this region for so long, little is known about their diet in this region.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In other regions, studies of otter stomach contents and scats (feces), indicate that 
	  they consume large amounts of fish, as well as crayfish, frogs, and various other 
	  amphibians, reptiles, and occasionally birds, and other mammals.  While otters are 
	  occasionally seen eating shellfish, little was known about how much they contribute to
	  the otter diet, because the contents are more fully digested and do not show up in 
	  scats, and are difficult to identify from stomach contents.
	</p>
	<p>
	  PRA principal, Damian Satterthwaite-Phillips led a research project that demonstrated 
	  that the different taxa in the otter diet have unique fatty acid signatures.  By 
	  comparing the fatty acids found in otter fat with those found in different prey 
	  species, the otter diet can be inferred to a very close approximation. We discovered 
	  that shellfish make up a much larger portion of the diet than previously suspected. 
	  This is important in areas of Illinois where there is high mussel diversity and many of
	  the species are endangered.  These findings can aid wildlife managers in protecting 
	  endangered mussels.

	    The image to the left shows the relative proportion of different fatty acids found in
	    different taxonomic groups, as determined from gas-liquid chromatography.  The 
	    different fatty acids are indicated along the x-axis. Chromatography works by 
	    separating different molecules (in this case, fatty acids). The fatty acids have
	    different molecular weights, typically causing the heavier molecules to pass through 
	    the chromatograph more slowly. However, there is some variation in retention time for
	    each sample, creating some ambiguity as to the identity of each molecule.  From other
	    literature published on fatty acids, we knew how many unique fatty acids should be 
	    present.  By running a k-means clustering algorithm, we were able to determine which 
	    molecules in each sample had the highest probability of matching the identity of the 
	    molecules in a standard with known fatty acids.

	    Principal components analysis (PCA) is a method that takes high-dimensional data, and 
	    projects those data onto fewer dimensions in a way that maximally preserves the 
	    variation between variables.  As an analogy, consider a 3-dimensional object like an 
	    umbrella, and the lower (2) dimensional shadow that it casts.  Turned one direction, 
	    the shadow may only appear as a circle, but turned another, the whole profile of the
	    umbrella is apparent.  PCA acts similarly to the second case--preserving the maximum 
	    amount of variability, while simultaneously reducing the dimensionality.  The image to
	    the left shows the PCA for different animal species.  The original variables were the 
	    percentages of each of the 60 fatty acids analyzed.  This 60-dimensional data is 
	    projected is shown here projected onto just 2 dimensions (principal components), that 
	    preserve the most variation.  This allows us to see which species are more similar to 
	    each other in terms of their fatty acid profiles.  For example, the otters (light blue
	    points) largely overlap with the fish (red), indicating that fish and otters have 
	    fairly similar fatty acid compositions.  Molluscs (dark blue), by contrast, form a 
	    separate cluster, indicating a rather different fatty acid profile.

	    <a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/02-4105">Quantitative fatty acid 
	    signature analysis</a> is a method developed by Professor Sara Iverson and her 
	    colleagues. It is based on the idea that a predator's fatty acid profile is more or 
	    less representative of its diet, when corrected for the fact that different prey 
	    species in the diet have different fat content.  (In our study, mussel species were
	    typically much fattier than crayfish, for example.)  Using their methods, we made use 
	    of an optimization routine (a "hill-climbing" algorithm, also known as 
	    "gradient-descent") that found the most probable proportion of each type of prey 
	    species in the otter diet.

	    This research determined that shellfish make up a considerably larger part of the 
	    otter diet than previously suspected.  In areas like Illinois, where otters have been 
	    successfully reintroduced, this information is important, because there is high 
	    shellfish diversity in some regions, and many of the local species are endangered.  
	    The findings from this research will allow wildlife managers to better protect those 
	    endangered species (for instance, by limiting otter trapping to those areas where
	    shellfish are at the highest risk).

	  <h2>White-Tailed Deer in Illinois</h2>
	  <h3>Disease-Control and Population Dynamics</h3>
	</hgroup>
	<p>
	  (This research is still in progress, but an interim report is available
	  <a href="http://wwx.inhs.illinois.edu/files/4113/7357/5137/Summer2012.pdf">here</a> 
	  [p. 4 - 5].)
	</p>
	<p>
	  In northern Illinois, chronic wasting disease was first identified in the white-tailed
	  deer population in 2002. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is similar to "Mad Cow" disease,
	  and if left unchecked, could potentially wipe out the entire herd.  Additionally, while
	  the chance of transmission to humans is small, there is no cure for the disease, and it
	  is always fatal. In order to prevent the disease from spreading, the Illinois 
	  Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) implemented a sharp-shooting program, aimed at 
	  decreasing the population density in areas where CWD has been known to occur.
	</p>
	<p>
	  In a cooperation with IDNR, PRA principal, Damian Satterthwaite-Phillips has been 
	  working with a team of researchers in the Department of Animal Science, and the 
	  Illinois Natural History Survey at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  
	  Because white-tailed deer are both an important part of the local ecosystem, and an 
	  important source of revenue to the state, we are closely monitoring the effects of the
	  sharp-shooting program on reproduction and population dynamics.
	</p>
	<p>
	  From all female deer that were culled in the sharp-shooting program, we track
	  various statistics including the location and date of culling, the age of the deer, 
	  whether or not the deer was CWD-positive, the number of fetuses present, and length and
	  mass measurements of all fetuses. We also track the intensity of the 
	  sharp-shooting in each area each year.  With 8 consecutive years of data, we have been
	  able to determine correlations between the intensity of the sharp shooting and various 
	  measures of reproduction, such as fecundity (measured by both the percentage of deers 
	  that are pregnant, and the average number of fetuses per doe), 
	  and fetal mass (which in turn is a good predictor of whether the newborn will survive 
	  its first year), which are indicators of the herd health.  While this research is still
	  in progress, the findings so far indicate that the sharp shooting is having minimal 
	  effects on the deer population, suggesting that this is an effective strategy for 
	  controlling the disease while simultaneously protecting the long-term health of the 
	  entire herd.  
	</p>

	    <img src="images/fetusDetection.png" class="frame left" width="450px", 
		 height="428px" />
	    In Illinois, the female white-tailed deer all become fertile and conceive at 
	    approximately the same time, so fetal development is also at the same stage for all 
	    pregnant deer at any given point in time.  Because this research depends on successful
	    detection of fetuses, we were concerned that detection may be poor in the earliest
	    stages of pregnancy when the fetuses were still quite small. The graph at the left
	    plots the percentage of deer found with fetuses as a function of the number of days 
	    counting from the new year.  To these data we fit the best sigmoid curve, which begins 
	    to level off at about 30 days into the new year, indicating that prior to that point, 
	    a considerable portion of fetuses escaped detection.  Hence we did not rely on any data
	    prior to this cutoff, as it would likely bias our results.
	  </p>
	  <p class="clear">
	    <img src="images/growthCurve.png" class="frame left" width="450px" height="428px" />
	    One of the metrics we look at as an indicator of both the mother's nutritional health, 
	    and the likelihood that the newborn fawn will survive, is the mass of the fetus.  
	    However because fetuses grow, they are, on average, heavier later in gestation.  By 
	    plotting the fetal lengths against their masses, we fit an exponential function to the 
	    data that allows us to understand how mass and length relate to each other over time, 
	    and correct for this variation.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In the course of this research, we are also modeling the effects of sharp-shooting
	    intensity on the percentage of deer in each age class (fawn, yearling, or adult), the
	    percentage of deer found pregnant, the number of fetuses per pregnancy, and the 
	    robustness of the fetuses (derived from the mass and length measurements).  Using 
	    various types of linear models, we control for other covariates, such as the geographic
	    region (some areas may provide better habitat and nutrition), the year (colder years 
	    may also be responsible for decreased fertility), the age of the pregnant deer (older
	    deer typically have larger litters), etc.

	<h3 class="clear">The Role of Heavy Metals in Chronic Wasting Disease</h3>
	<p>
	  (This research is currently under peer-review for publication. A link will be provided
	  when published.)
	</p>
	<p>
	  Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease found in cervid species such as deer 
	  and elk. CWD is similar to bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("Mad Cow" disease) in 
	  cattle, scrapie in sheep, and Creutzfeld-Jacob disease and kuru in humans. The disease
	  is caused by a misfolded protein found in the nervous system.  The misfolded protein is
	  infectious, and causes other proteins to misfold, ultimately leading to a chain 
	  reaction of misfoldings that results in the deterioration of the nervous tissue. In 
	  deer, the disease is thought to be transmissible through saliva, urine, and feces, and
	  is always fatal.
	</p>
	<p>
	  There are likely many factors that contribute to a deer's susceptibility to CWD, 
	  including the amounts of different essential nutrients in the diet.  For example, the
	  protein that may become infectious typically bonds with a copper atom (cofactor), and 
	  the bonds help the protein to keep its shape.  When there is insufficient copper in the
	  diet, other metals such as magnesium may replace the copper in the protein.  However, 
	  the bonds formed with magnesium appear to be weaker and may leave the protein more 
	  susceptible to misfolding and becoming infectious.
	</p>
	<p>
	  PRA principal, Damian Satterthwaite-Phillips has been providing statistical support to
	  a group of veterinarians and scientists at the Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS) 
	  at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). This research is aimed at 
	  detecting differences in the concentrations of different metals in diseased and healthy
	  deer, while correcting for other possible sources of variation such as sex, age, and 
	  variation in the mineral content of the soils in different regions, as well as 
	  providing baseline measurements of these metals in healthy deer.  These finding will 
	  aid in the understanding of CWD epidemiology, and may suggest methods for controlling 
	  CWD, such as providing mineral fortified salt licks in regions where certain nutrients
	  are poor.
