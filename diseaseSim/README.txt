This R script is a simulator for disease prevalence and population dynamics 
given a variety of user-specified parameters governing the population and 
disease (e.g. proportions of different age and sex classes, reproductive rates,
mortality, disease infectiousness, etc.)

A fuller narrative is involved in the html file (also online at 
http://phillips-research.com/diseaseSim.html).  I tried to make everything
as self-explanatory as possible, but feel free to contact me with 
questions or comments.
