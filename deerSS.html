	  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	  <p>
	    Culling is a frequently used method for controlling disease in 
	    wildlife populations. In the case of density-dependent disease, 
	    culling has a two-fold effect—it reduces contact rates and
	    therefore disease transmission between hosts (Barlow 1996), and by 
	    culling infective hosts, the infective contribution of that host is
	    also diminished.  Modeling tools indicate that culling may also be 
	    an effective strategy when the disease is frequency dependent
	    (Potapov et al. 2012).  State agencies rely on hunter harvest to
	    maintain deer population structures, and mathematical models 
	    specific to chronic wasting disease (CWD) control emphasize the
	    importance of population reduction (Gross and Miller 2001, 
	    Wasserberg et al. 2009).  In Illinois, CWD is managed through a 
	    combination of hunter harvest and intensive localized sharpshooting
	    in CWD-infected areas.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Chronic wasting disease in white-tailed deer (<em>Odocoileus
	      virginianus</em>) was first reported in Illinois just south of
	    the Wisconsin state line from a suspect deer in November 2002 (IDNR
	    2003). Statewide surveillance of hunter-harvested deer that year
	    detected 6 additional cases in northern Illinois.  Subsequent to 
	    detection of the first CWD case, the Illinois Department of Natural
	    Resources (IDNR) initiated an annual sharpshooting (SS) program to 
	    decrease deer densities, remove CWD-infected deer, and manage the 
	    disease in localized areas of high risk of disease transmission and
	    where CWD was known to occur (IDNR 2003).  The sharpshooting (SS) 
	    program in Illinois was non-selective and was intended to:
	    <ol> 
	      <li>
		reduce deer populations to a degree greater than hunting in 
		sections infected with CWD or at high risk of infection, and 
	      </li>
	      <li>
		introduce a mechanism of disease control in areas with limited 
		hunting grounds and high human density.
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Because of the timing of breeding and fawning relative to
	    conventional hunting seasons, reproduction in white-tailed deer
	    (WTD) is often evaluated using observational estimates of fawn
	    numbers (offspring per doe), lactation rates in does, or
	    examination of ovarian corpora albicantia during harvest (Schwartz
	    1998).  In contrast, SS took place after the breeding season, while
	    does were pregnant, allowing us to take measurements on fetuses
	    directly.  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Fecundity in WTD, indicated by pregnancy rates  (number of
	    pregnant does / total number of does) and fetuses-per-pregnancy is
	    influenced by a number of factors such as the age of the mother and
	    habitat quality.  In Ohio, with deer habitat similar to that in
	    northern Illinois, WTD were estimated to average 2.0 fetuses per
	    pregnancy (Nixon 1971).  In other regions, fetuses per pregnancy
	    have been reported to be somewhat lower: 1.5 in Texas (Kie and
	    White 1985); 1.6 in Iowa (Haugen 1975); 1.6 – 1.7 in South
	    Carolina (Dapson et al. 1979). The relatively high numbers of
	    fetuses per pregnancy in Ohio indicate the high-quality habitat for
	    WTD, a condition similar to that of Illinois. Fawn pregnancy rates
	    have been reported to range from 2-29% (DeYoung 2011).  In a
	    captive deer population in Michigan with supplemental food, as many
	    as half the doe fawns became pregnant (Ozoga 1987).  The Michigan
	    study further indicates that high doe fawn fecundity and the 
	    frequency of triplet and quadruplet litters in older does reflect
	    high-quality habitat and excellent nutrition (Ozoga 1987).  
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Factors that affect fecundity may also affect fetal development as
	    indicated by fetal crown-rump length, fetal mass or fetal sex
	    ratios (Jacobson 1976).  Sex ratios in WTD deer are sensitive to
	    time of conception during estrus with later conception leading to
	    higher proportions of males.  Although time of conception may be
	    density dependent (Verme & Ozoga 1981) Bonenfant et al. (2003) did
	    not find significant changes in the sex ratio at any density below
	    carrying capacity.  However, in red deer (<em>Cervus elaphus</em>),
	    the proportion of males born declined as population density (Kruuk
	    et al. 1999) and nutritional stress (Mysterud et al. 2000)
	    increased.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Because SS in Illinois has been conducted over 10 years during
	    pregnancy, it allowed us to measure reproduction based on observed
	    fetal characteristics directly; over the last 10 years we have
	    collected data from 5594 fetuses taken from 4748 does.  These
	    numbers are an order of magnitude larger than frequently cited
	    papers on deer reproduction which commonly range in the hundreds.
	    The direct measures of reproduction examined in this study will 
	    provide information on the response of deer to CWD management 
	    intervention through very localized population reduction efforts.  
	    Our objectives were:
	    <ol>
	      <li>
		to provide summary statistics of  reproductive parameters in
		Illinois WTD
	      </li>
	      <li>
		to examine the impact of the Illinois SS program on
		reproduction and fetal development in white-tailed deer; and
	      </li>
	      <li>to assess whether CWD affected reproductive parameters.</li>
	    </ol>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Because the SS program differs from hunting in that higher rates of
	    culling occur in smaller, more focused loci, we examined its impact
	    on reproduction at the same geographic scale.  Illinois provides
	    high-quality deer habitat and deer densities have been reported to
	    be below carrying capacity (Roseberry and Woolf 1991, 1998).  
	    Therefore, we predicted that an increase in SS intensity would not
	    significantly affect:
	    <ol>
	      <li>fecundity</li>
	      <li>fetal sex ratios</li>
	      <li>fetal development.</li>
	    </ol>
	    To our knowledge, this study represents the largest dataset of does
	    and fetuses ever available to study reproductive characteristics in
	    deer.  The magnitude of these data allows for detection of
	    relatively small changes and with high statistical significance.

	  <h3>Study Area</h3>
	  <p>
	    Our study area included portions of northern Illinois, USA, where
	    SS was conducted for disease control within 13 counties affected by
	    CWD between 2003 and 2010. The Public Land Survey System divides 
	    the state of Illinois into a grid of 9.7 km by 9.7 km squares, each
	    a unique township.  Because of state line boundaries, and 
	    occasionally other historical divisions, some townships differ in
	    size, but the vast majority are 94.1 square km (36 sq. miles; US
	    Dept. of the Interior 2009, 2011).  Each township is further
	    subdivided into a grid of 1.6 km by 1.6 km squares called sections.
	    The section was our geographical unit of analysis.  Locations of
	    all deer culled by sharpshooting were recorded to the appropriate 
	    township, range, and section according to the Public Land Survey
	    System (US Dept. of the Interior 2011).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Throughout the greater region of northern Illinois, the landscape
	    has been described as highly fragmented.  The deer habitat
	    consists of patches of forest, mixed with both agricultural and
	    urban regions with urban development greatest in the Chicago
	    metropolitan area (Piccolo et al. 2001).  The fragmented patches of
	    woodland provide substantial amounts of preferred edge habitat
	    (Whitehead 1972) found at the forest-field boundaries and along
	    wooded riparian corridors (Nixon et al. 1991, 2008).  The study 
	    area is part of the Great Plains region, with minimal topographical
	    relief, and has temperate continental climate with cold winters
	    (mean = –3° C in January) and warm summers (mean = 24° C in July; 
	    Nixon et al. 2008).

	    <h3>Methods</h3>
	    <h5><em>Sharpshooting for CWD control</em>.—</h5> 
	  </hgroup>
	  <p>
	    IDNR conducts a statewide
	    program for CWD monitoring based on the following sources of
	    samples: suspect deer, hunter harvest, deer population control
	    permits, deer reduction permits, deer-vehicle collisions and SS.  
	    The Illinois Department of Agriculture Animal Disease Laboratories
	    in Galesburg and Centralia, (IL) used retropharyngeal lymph nodes
	    and brain tissue (obex) for CWD testing using immunohistochemistry 
	    (O’Rourke et al. 1998) as the diagnostic test. Chronic wasting
	    disease control relies on an adaptive management strategy based on
	    SS to reduce the deer population in infected sections, and
	    high-risk areas (including at least a 2-section buffer around each
	    positive section; Shelton and Hulin 2004).  The SS sites are thus
	    limited to a square with 8-km sides.  Sharpshooting took place from
	    15 January to 30 March each year, shortly after the completion of
	    the breeding season, following the identification of CWD-infected
	    sections from prior surveillance. Biologists from IDNR baited 
	    sites, and removed all deer that came to the site, without 
	    intention of selective removal by age or sex.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Biologists from IDNR determined sex and age of culled deer.  Age 
	    was determined by dental morphology and wear (Severinghaus 1949).  
	    This aging method can overestimate the age of young adults (2 yrs),
	    and underestimate age in older (≥4 yrs) deer (Hamlin et al. 2000, 
	    Gee et al. 2002, Meares et al. 2006).  We therefore limited our
	    classification to fawns (<1 yr), yearlings (1 - 2 yrs) and adults 
            (≥2 yrs). Biologists from IDNR also collected and submitted fetus
	    samples from the deer culled by SS to the University of Illinois at
	    Urbana-Champaign, where we recorded fetal crown-rump length 
	    (Jacobson 1976), sex, mass and litter size.
	  </p>
	    
	  <h3>Study Design</h3>
	  <p>
	    We measured reproductive traits from all does killed by SS in a
	    given year.  These traits included the percentage of pregnant does,
	    the number of fetuses per pregnancy, fetal development as measured
	    by the ratio of crown-rump length to mass, and fetal sex ratios. 
	    The level of prior SS for each section was quantified by prior
	    intensity, defined as the mean number of does culled annually from
	    the section in all prior years.  Intensity is calculated as a
	    cumulative value over all preceding years excluding the present 
	    year.  (Because SS occurred after the breeding season, it could not
	    impact reproductive parameters until subsequent breeding seasons.)
	    For instance, a prior intensity value of 7 indicates a mean of 7
	    deer culled per year by SS across all sharpshot years in that
	    section prior to the current year’s measurements of reproduction.  
	    That is,<br />
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Prior intensity<em><sub>t</sub></em>
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		= sum(<em>n<sub>i</sub></em>) / (<em>t</em> - 1); 
		<em>t</em> > <em>a</em>, and
              </li>
              <li>
		= 0; <em>t</em> = <em>a</em>
	      </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
            for <em>i</em> = (1, 2, ..., <em>t</em> - 1), where <em>t</em> is
            the year of the given sample, <em>a</em> is the first year in which
            the given section was sharpshot, and <em>n<sub>i</sub></em> 
            represents the number of deer culled in the given section in the 
            <em>i</em>th year.  The numerator represents the total number of 
	    deer culled prior to year <em>t</em> (<em>t</em> = the year in
	    which reproductive measurements were taken), and the denominator is
	    the total number of elapsed years in that period since SS was
	    initiated.  When <em>t</em> = <em>a</em>, this represents the first
	    year that SS occurred in the section; because there was no prior 
	    SS, prior intensity = 0.  Each data point represents the prior
	    intensity per section per year.  Because SS was a sustained as well
	    as an adaptive CWD control and management strategy, different
	    sections received different numbers of SS years so, for a given
	    section, prior intensity may have changed over time as additional
	    SS occurred.  Prior intensity values ranged among sections from 0
	    to 46 females culled per year.
